# airflow-bq-dbt

This repository is dedicated to developing and showcasing an end-to-end data engineering project, with a focus on workflow orchestration and data ingestion using Apache Airflow, data transformation via dbt (Data Build Tool), and storage and analysis in Google BigQuery.

### Key Features:

**Workflow Orchestration**: Utilize Apache Airflow for orchestrating and managing the entire data pipeline, including task scheduling, dependency management, and error handling.

**Data Ingestion**: Implement data ingestion processes using Airflow, which involve extracting data from various sources and loading it into Google BigQuery.

**Data Transformation**: Use dbt models to transform the ingested data, making it suitable for analysis and business intelligence purposes.

**Documentation and Best Practices**: Comprehensive documentation detailing the pipeline's construction, the rationale behind design choices, challenges faced, and the implementation of data engineering best practices.

**Skill Showcase**: The project aims to demonstrate practical skills in data engineering, covering various aspects from data extraction to insights generation.

The goal of this project is to serve as a practical learning resource for those venturing into data engineering and to showcase my capabilities in handling real-world data engineering tasks. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are highly encouraged to improve the project's educational value and practical applicability.
